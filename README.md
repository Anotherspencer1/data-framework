# Overview

This program has 3 functions. It returns the top 5 most populous countries, returns the total global population over the years, and it returns the information on a user selcted country.

This program analyzes a database on world population over time. The [database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/world-population-dataset) is found on Kaggle.com.

This program was created with the intention of learning more about data analysis and working with Python Pandas. 
{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the data set, the questions and answers, the code running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Data Analysis Results

* Q1: What are the 5 most poulated countries?
* A1: China, India, United States, Indonesia, Pakistan
* Q2: What does the global population look like over time?
* A1: In 1970 the poulation was 3,694,136,661 and it rose to 7,973,413,042 in 2022. (The actual results in the program include updated results for every 10 years or so)
* Q3:What are the population and other statistics of x country like? (eg: Afghanistan)
* A3: It is ranked 36 for population with a population of 41,128,771 in 2022. It has a growth rate of 1.0257%. (More information is included in the actual program.)

# Development Environment

I used visual studio code to create this program.

Everything was written in python with the pandas library.

# Useful Websites

* [Python Pandas Data](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.sort_values.html)

# Future Work

* Add more ways for the user to find the information that they want.
* Allow user to search for a list of countries, rather than just one at a time.
* Do some more bug testing and find any remaining bugs or inconsistencies.
